The present project uses content based reccoemndation system to reccomend similar movies to a movie, one has recently watched. 
It has used a sample of 5000 movies from a TMDB movie dataset. Then the similarity has been found using cossine similarity index after
converting the movies related tags into vector form using tf-idf vectorizer. 

Note: one important similarity.pkl file is not uploaded here because of size limit. One can always run the reccomender.py code and generate the same.
